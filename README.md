# spidy Web Crawler
Spidy (/spÀà…™di/) is the simple, easy to use command line web crawler.<br>
Given a list of web links, it uses the Python [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org) library to query the webpages.<br>
Spidy then uses [`lxml`](http://lxml.de/index.html) to extract all links from the page and adds them to its list.<br>
Pretty simple!

Developed by [rivermont](https://github.com/rivermont) (/r…™v…úÀêrm…ínt/) and [FalconWarriorr](https://github.com/Casillas-) (/f√¶lc ånra…™j…îÀêr/).<br>

# New Features!

### Domain Limiting - #[e229b01](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/commit/e229b01eed7e1f95530d06afc671e40dbf4dac53)
Scrape only a single site instead of the whole internet. May use slightly less space on your disk.<br>
See `/config/wsj.cfg` for an example.

### Release v1.0!
[spidy Web Crawler Release 1.0](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/releases/tag/1.0)

### PEP 8 Compliance - #[133dcdc](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/commit/133dcdc02a0d63d94725cb86c089b7fdb3eba2d4)
98% of code now obeys the PEP 8 standard.<br>
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the Style Guide for all Python code.

### Better File Saving - #[8c0dcd4](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/commit/8c0dcd4d637eadde4326065cbed74eafcb381dbe)
Now uses the `Content-Type` header to determine how to save files.<br>
Also cut the number of requests to sites in half, effectively killing HTTP 429 Errors.

# How it Works
Spidy has two working lists, `TODO` and `done`.<br>
TODO is the list of URLs it hasn't yet visited.<br>
Done is the list of URLs it has already been to.<br>
The crawler visits each page in TODO, scrapes the DOM of the page for links, and adds those back into TODO.<br>
It also saves each page, because datahoarding üòú.


# Features
We built a lot of the functionality in spidy by watching the console scroll by and going, "Hey, we should add that!"<br>
Here are some features we figure are worth noting.

## Configuration
Spidy comes 'preloaded' with multiple configuration files.<br>
These set variables for the crawler and tell it how to behave.

## Error Handling
We have tried to recognize all of the errors spidy runs into and create custom error messages and logging for each.<br>
There is a set cap so that after accumulating too many errors the crawler will stop itself.<br>
Currently spidy has built-in support for:

  - ConnectionError
  - ContentDecodingError
  - HTTPError
  - OSError
  - SSLError
  - UnicodeEncodeError
  - TooManyRedirects
  - XMLSyntaxError, ParserError

## Frequent Timestamp Logging
Spidy logs almost every action it takes to both the console and one of two log files.

## Portability
Move spidy's folder and its contents somewhere else and it will run right where it left off.

## User-Friendly Logs
Both the console and log file messages are simple and easy to interpret, but packed with information.

## Webpage saving
Spidy downloads each page that it runs into, regardless of file type.<br>
The crawler uses the HTTP `Content-Type` header returned with most files to determine the file type.

## File Zipping
When autosaving, spidy can archive the contents of the `saved/` directory to a `.zip` file, and then clear `saved/`.


# Tutorial
The way that you will run spidy depends on the way you have Python installed.<br>
Spidy can be run from the command line, a Python IDE, or (on Windows systems) by launching the `.bat` file.

## Python Installation
There are many different versions of [Python](https://www.python.org/about/), and hundreds of different installations for each them.<br>
Spidy is developed for Python v3.6.1, but should run without errors in other versions of Python 3.

### Anaconda
We recommend the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).<br>
It comes pre-packaged with lots of goodies, including `lxml`, which is required for spidy to run and not including in the standard Python package.

### Python Base
You can also just install [default Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and install `lxml` separately.<br>
This can be done with `pip`:

> pip install lxml

## Launching

![](/media/run.gif?raw=true)

### Windows (Command Line)
Use `cd` to navigate to the directory spidy's located in, then run `clear.bat`.<br>
This will create all of the necessary files if they don't already exist.

> python crawler.py

We like to use Windows Powershell, but spidy will work in either `cmd.exe` or Powershell.

### Windows (batch file)
Use `cd` to navigate to spidy's directory and run `makefiles.bat`.<br>
This will create all of the necessary files if they don't already exist.<br>
Then run `run.bat`.

### Config
On running, spidy may ask for input regarding its various arguments.<br>
However, you can also use one of the configuration files, or even create your own.

To use spidy with a configuration file, use the command:

> python crawler.py <fileName>

Where `<fileName>` is the name of the config file - minus the `.cfg` extension.

The config files included with spidy are:

  - *`blank.txt`*: Template for creating your own configurations.
  - `default.cfg`: The default version.
  - `heavy.cfg`: Run spidy with all of its features enabled.
  - `light.cfg`: Disable most features; only crawls pages for links.
  - `rivermont.cfg`: My personal favorite settings.

## Running
Spidy logs a lot of information to the command line.<br>
Once started, a bunch of `[INIT]` lines will print.<br>
These announce where spidy is in its initialization process.<br>

### Expected Behaviour
Some things that spidy may do that look bad but really aren't:

  - Getting stuck pruning links.
    - At startup, the crawler sometimes gets stuck on `[spidy] [INIT]: Pruning invalid links from TODO...`.
	- It has to process every link in the TODO list, which can be hundreds of thousands of lines long.
  - Lots of [ERR]: HTTP 429: Too Many Requests

### Start
Sample start log.

![](/media/start.png?raw=true)

### Autosave
Sample log after hitting the autosave cap.

![](/media/log.png?raw=true)

### Force Quit
Sample log after performing a `^C` (CONTROL + C) to force quit the crawler.

![](/media/keyboardinterrupt.png?raw=true)

### End
Sample log after crawler visits all links in TODO.

![](/media/end.png?raw=true)


# Files

### config/
Contains configuration files.

### media/
Contains the images used in this README file.

## Save Files
Some of these files will be created when `crawler.py` is first run.

### crawler_todo.txt
Contains all of the links that spidy has found but not yet crawled.

### crawler_done.txt
Contains all of the links that spidy has already visited.

### crawler_bad.txt
Contains all of the links that caused errors for some reason.

### crawler_words.txt
Contains all of the words that spidy has found.

## Run Files

### crawler.py
The important code. This is what you will run to crawl links and save information.<br>
Because the internet is so big, this will practically never end.

### gui.py
The development file for a GUI.


# Branches

## master
The stable, up-to-date branch.

## FalconWarriorr-branch
Falconwarriorr's branch.<br>
He has developed a bunch of features that we are working on merging into master.


# Contribute
We would love your help with anything!<br>
Right now neither of us have access to a Linux or OS/X machine, so we don't have any documentation for running spidy on those systems.<br>
If you find a bug raise an issue, and if you have a suggestion go ahead and fork it.<br>
We will happily look at anything that you build off of spidy; we're not very creative people and we know that there're more ideas out there!

## TODO
This project is far from done; this is a list of planned features:

  - Move page crawling/scraping/saving to a `crawl()` function.
  - Automatic bug testing with Travis CI
  - Versions for Windows, Mac, Linux
  - Working GUI
  - Multiple HTTP threads at once - need to communicate
  - Respecting of `robots.txt`
  - More thorough documentation
  - spidy on PyPI and pip

Thanks!
