# Contributing
We would love your help with anything!<br>
Right now neither of us have access to a Linux or OS/X machine, so we don't have any documentation for running spidy on those systems.<br>
If you find a bug raise an issue, and if you have a suggestion go ahead and fork it.<br>
We will happily look at anything that you build off of spidy; we're not very creative people and we know that there're more ideas out there!

--------------------

## Notable TODOs

  - Linux and OS/X support
  - Better documentation `docs.md` and the README are both rather outdated
  - Working GUI - the remnants of our efforts can be found in `gui.py`

### Less Important

  - Automatic bug dealing-with with Travis CI and/or Sentry would be nice
  - Multiple HTTP threads at once, but they need to coordinate their page lists
  - Respecting of `robots.txt`
  - PyPI/pip/apt
